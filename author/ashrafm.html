</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>There were times when I felt I wanted to walk instead of running. It's not that I didn't have the energy to run. My legs were still capable to keep running. But why, I decided to walk instead of run ?</p>
<p>It comes down to motivation, self-discipline and goal</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>Why do you want to keep running ? Is it because you want to complete within the given time for the medal ? Or is it because you want to beat your personal record ? Or perhaps you have your own personal reason ? Find that motivation and remind yourself of that movitation whenever you feel want to stop.</p>
<p><strong>Self-discipline</strong></p>
<p>For some reasons, your might feel demotivated at certain points during the run. At this point, the only thing that will push you is your self-discipline. You don't stop no matter what because you are one hell of disciplined running mice. You have to run whether you like it or otherwise. Reminding yourself of your strong self-discipline definitely will help.</p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<p>One common area in both of the factors is you need some kind of goal. Without the goal, you have nothing to look forward to. Without the goal, no amount of motivation or self-discipline will keep you moving.</p>
<p>All these areas are applicable to life in general.</p>
<p>To keep going in life, you'll need a goal, some motivation and one hell of self-discipline.</p>

<li>Event : Kuala Lumpur City Day Run 2017 </li>
<li>Location : Padang Merbok route </li>
<li>Date : 26th Feb 2017 </li>
<li>Start time : 730am </li>
<li>Weather : Raining in the beginning</li>
</ul>
<h2>Review</h2>
<p>Somehow, I felt this was my worst outdoor running event but yet for some miracle, I did manage to get my best time for this event.</p>
<p>In my previous event, my average pace was 7&#8217;35&#8221; min/km. This new event however I managed to get 7&#8217;08&#8221; min/km</p>
<p>Some reflections on this run :</p>
<p><strong>1&#46; Running in the rain sucks.</strong> This was my first time running in the rain. It seems more energy was needed to run in this condition &#8211; to get rid of stressful feeling running wet, to carry water drenched clothes, to keep your face clear from rain water distraction while running</p>
<p><strong>2&#46; Hilly run.</strong> I was not expecting something like this &#8211; too many uphills. I walked for all the uphills. If I were to run again on this route, I might be mentally prepared on what should I do. My advice &#8211; for uphill run, try to continuously run (slow is OK) but if you can&#8217;t, do short bursts. But for downhill: don&#8217;t stop, keep running with long stride. This is the key to get better average pace.</p>
<p><strong>3&#46; Motivation to continuously run.</strong> During my previous run, the only thing that kept me running continuously was my desire to get the finisher medal and hence I must run within the time limit for the medal. I had no previous reference so I was so scared I might not make it which led to continuos run in the past event.</p>
<p>However, this time was different. I knew, no matter the completion time, I&#8217;ll get the medal. The only question was &#8211; can I finish within 1 hour 30 mins for E-Cert. To run within this time limitation was the only motivation I had.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to many uphills, I was demotivated and thought that I might not make it which led to &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t be bothered. This led to lots of walking compared to previous event.</p>
<p>I kept going though so that at least I was not that far off from the time limit. To my surprise, I did manage to run 12km within the time limit.</p>
<p>I knew I was more than capable to do better because during the final 1km, I could still run strongly with long stride.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a good experience to run on hilly Padang Merbok route.</p>
<p>Until next time !</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>It was not really a total misery but still it&#8217;s a fucked up month compared to others. During the whole February, I felt something was off. I was kinda rebellious. I wanted to do something different from of my routine. I simply wanted to quit.</p>
<p>Hence, no strict rule of eating during the whole month, which led to bad diet and weight gain. The workout/exercise was still OK. I managed to keep my exercise for most of the weeks. I did miss 1 or 2 days for certain weeks but it was still OK for my standard.</p>
<p>This whole &#8220;off mood&#8221; scenario seems to be caused by certain factors :</p>
<p><strong>1- No significant weight loss</strong> Weight loss was my biggest motivator to keep me going. I knew I could reduce at least 1kg per week. However, lately, it seems that&#8217;s a bit hard to achieve. Sometimes, I felt I had reached a plateau.</p>
<p>This led me to disappointment and hence rebellious act &#8211; the fuck do I care what I am gonna eat.</p>
<p><strong>2- Broken weight scale</strong> My old weight scale was not responsive anymore. Hence, I went to look for reliable scale. Bought a new one, but the new one seems to be showing varying readings depending on where I put the scale.</p>
<p>I was obsessed with the accuracy and this new scale didn&#8217;t live up to my expectation. Another dissapointment which led to &#8211; the fuck with the weight attitude.</p>
<p><strong>3- Boredom</strong> Routine is boring. I had been doing the same routine for few months already. I needed to vent somewhere which led to &#8211; the fuck with the all these routines, I&#8217;ll do whatever I want.</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>To tackle this challenge, I have come out with the following solutions :</p>
<p><strong>1- Fuck obsession with the weight readings</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m doing right now. Instead of focusing on the weight readings, I should change my focus to my activity. Let&#8217;s just eat right and keep exercising. Slowly, the results will take care itself.</p>
<p><strong>2- If it&#8217;s right, keep doing it</strong> If you have been exercising all this while, why do have to feel dissapointed when there is no result ? Fuck result. Focus on the process and activity.</p>
<p><strong>3- Lifestyle</strong> This is the ultimate solution. Turn your good habit into lifetyle. No matter the result. Lifestyle will keep you going whenever you face any adversary.</p>
<p><strong>4- No more &#8220;it&#8217;s just this one time&#8221; attitude</strong> This same excuse or some sort of similar excuse has plagued those who want to change for the better. Truth is, this is just an excuse you tell yourself to do what you shouldn&#8217;t do in the first place. You just want to avoid that guilty feeling. That&#8217;s all.</p>

<p>Use it depending on the situation or intention of your talk :</p>
<p><strong>1. Palm face up</strong> &#8211; to be more persuasive, to influence the crowd to accept the presented idea</p>
<p><strong>2. Palm face down</strong> &#8211; to show power and authority, to subtly exert power over the audience to &#8220;follow&#8221; your idea</p>
<p><strong>3. Finger pointing</strong> &#8211; worst of all, don&#8217;t use it. It&#8217;s a rude way to tell something to someone.</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p><strong>1. Be proactive</strong> Focus your energy on what you can control &#8211; your circle of influence. Things that are out of your control (your circle of concerns) should be the least priority in your mind.</p>
<p><strong>2. Begin with the end in mind</strong> This is the big picture view of everything. You do something because it&#8217;s related to your end goal. Having end goal in mind lets you prioritize your task. The goal helps you to creatively develop and find the &#8220;required&#8221; tasks to achieve your goals.</p>
<p><strong>3. Put first things first</strong> All the tasks that you perform can be categorized into 4 quadrants. The priority of the tasks should be in the following order : Not urgent, but important &gt; Urgent, important &gt; Urgent, not important &gt; Not urgent, not important</p>
<p><strong>4. Think win/win</strong> This is the ultimate relationship goal. All involved parties benefit from the relationship. The relationship flourishes and all involved parties would do anything to keep the relationship going.</p>
<p><strong>5. Seek first to understand, then to be understood</strong> This is the key to the effective communication. You have to listen and understand your audience before you try to deliver your message. Once you understand their reasons from their perspective, then you can adapt your message to their situation so that you can be understood.</p>
<p><strong>6. Synergize</strong> This refers to putting together all the available resources and optimize their capabilities to achieve the best possible output. In simple words- work together, complement each other, strategize and optimize the capabilities .</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>Writing is not easy especially when you need to convey a complicated idea in an uncomplicated way.</p>
<p>Your brain needs to form coherent sentences, not to mention coherent ideas or train of thoughts to get to the point.</p>
<p>Otherwise, your reader will lose interest to continue reading, leaving the main idea &#8220;untouched&#8221;. Too bad, failed writing communication.</p>
<p>This whole process will require sound executive brain function. Writing will make you to think hard.</p>
<p>To some, writing is like solving puzzle. You need to figure out how to put all the pieces together so that you can show the big picture at the end of your final piece.</p>
<p>My main motivation behind writing is solely to get my brain working hard to produce articulate idea.</p>
<p>I am not a good writer but I do know what practice can do. Over a year period, if I keep doing what I am doing I will see a huge change.</p>
<p>Consistent is the key. To be consistent, a reminder is a must &#8211; at least at the beginning stage.</p>
<p>Once it turns into a habit, you&#8217;ll be unstoppable. You will feel something is missing or something is not right if you don&#8217;t do it.</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>Rejection is emotionally painful. It can lead to all sort of negative feelings &#8211; sad, angry, disappointment, embarrassment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these feelings will influence your action, your attitude, your response to the world around you.</p>
<p>If you allow yourself to respond negatively to these emotions, you will always be in a losing position. Your emotion won&#8217;t get stronger.</p>
<p>In order to change this, you need to continuously expose yourself to the rejections and at the same time you control how you respond to the situations.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll train your emotion to adapt to the rejections. Over time, you will be calmer, more relaxed, less temper when facing the rejections.</p>
<p>After a while, rejection won&#8217;t intimidate you anymore. You&#8217;ll feel &#8216;mehhh&#8217; and you move on. At this point, you will be unstoppable. No rejection can change your emotion.</p>
<p>Those with muscular body or incredible strength don&#8217;t simply get big or strong overnight. It takes time and lots of exercise.</p>
<p>The same goes with your emotion. Get rejected often. Control how your respond. Strengthen your emotion.</p>
<p>Soon, you will be unstoppable.</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>The talk by Dave Fontenot @ TedXTeen : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VakF2hZFPQ">Hack your life in 48 hours</a></p>
<p>Key points from this talk :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dedicate a few days to build something. 2 &#8211; 3 days is good enough. Block out everything else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t code, just join the hackathon around you to get the exposure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is no hackathon around you, start small with friends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build something you want to build regardless your knowledge level. If you don&#8217;t know, get help through Google or friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The end product doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect. Doesn&#8217;t have to be full pledge big product either. Functional is good enough.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>My personal view on this:</strong></p>
<p>Hackathon is a good culture to develop more builders, inventors, creators. Here, we are conditioned to be consumers instead of creators. As a result, we ,as a nation, are highly dependable on the tech creator nations. Simply put, we are at their mercy.</p>
<p>To change this consumer mentality, leaders of this country has to steer the direction of the country towards innovation. It has to be done by those who care about the fate of this country.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it will be another messy corruption behind the name of &#8220;developing the nation&#8221;</p>
<p>This is how Japan changed from shogunate to modernization. The starting point of this change was during Meiji restoration era.</p>
<p>The political power was restored to the emperor from the shogun. Once in power, the emperor did what was necessary to modernize Japan and consequently turn Japan into an independent nation.</p>
<p>This can be done &#8211; if everyone in this country actually <strong>cares</strong> about this country</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>The notes are based on his talk. Watch his video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK1nMQq67VI">here</a></p>
<p>These points are basically from his book Brain Rules. He only talked a few of them in this video.</p>
<p>Some of the key points from the video :</p>
<p>1- The brain is designed to solve problem related to <strong>surviving</strong>, in unstable outdoor environment and to do so in constant motion</p>
<p>2- Exercise boosts brain power.</p>
<p><strong>Aerobic exercise</strong> can significantly improve executive function of the brain. Weight lifting however doesn&#8217;t seem to improve this function.</p>
<p>Both aerobic &amp; weight lifting doesn&#8217;t enhance the memory function.</p>
<p>Exercise specifically aerobic exercise can reduce cognitive pathology (depression, dimentia, etc)</p>
<p>How much exercise to get cognitive improvement? <strong>2 &#8211; 3 times a week of 20 minutes aerobic exercise</strong></p>
<p>3- Stressed brains don&#8217;t learn the same way as unstressed brain. Stress can &#8216;damage&#8217; the brain. The more stress you feel, the less productive you&#8217;ll be.</p>
<p><strong>Relax and learn</strong></p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><h2>Problem :</h2>
<p>You have a WordPress site, with Apache 2 server. How do you run Flask application alongside your WordPress site ?</p>
<h2>Solution :</h2>
<p>I assume that you have already created python program for your flask app. Let say your main python flask app filename is <code>testapp.py</code></p>
<p><strong>1&#46; Get wsgi mod</strong> for Apache web server. Use package installer.</p>
<p>In Ubuntu case :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>apt install libapache2-mod-wsgi
</pre></div>


<p>What is WSGI (web server gateway interface) ? It&#8217;s how your webserver &#8216;talks&#8217; to your application.</p>
<p>App&#8217;s output/input needs some kind of connection with the webserver so that this output/input can be channeled back/to the user&#8217;s browser request. This is where WSGI comes into picture.</p>
<p><strong>2&#46; Create wsgi file</strong> for your application. This will be located at the same level as your main flask app python file because we will call our flask app from this wsgi file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span> <span class="nn">from</span> <span class="nn">testapp</span> <span class="nn">import</span> <span class="nn">app</span>

<span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">insert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">&#39;/directory-path-to-your-app&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note : <strong>testapp</strong> is your main python flask app file (that consists of your Flask app entry point) and <strong>app</strong> is your Flask app that you define in your testapp.py</p>
<p>Save this file as testapp.wsgi</p>
<p><strong>3&#46; Modify your Apache conf file.</strong> Normally it&#8217;s located in <code>site-enabled</code> folder at <code>/etc/apache2/</code> Append the following within <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code> tags.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>WSGIScriptAlias /flaskroot /directory-path-to-your-testapp.wsgi
<span class="nt">&lt;Directory</span> <span class="err">/directory-path-to-your-app</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
         Require all granted
<span class="nt">&lt;/Directory&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note: <code>flaskroot</code> is the root link where your app will be accessed from the browser. It can be any name/link but obviously it can not be at the same location as your WordPress homepage link or other links that are generated by the WordPress (blog posts, pages, categories)</p>
<p>This is the simplest way to modify your Apache conf file. If you need more secured way to do this, you can follow <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/mod_wsgi/">flask apache deployment</a></p>
<p><strong>4&#46; Reload your Apache server</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo service apache2 reload
</pre></div>


<p><strong>5&#46; Try to access your flask app via the link</strong> on your browser to see if what you have done is working.</p>
<p>Let say you define helloworld function in testapp.py that prints out strings in your browser.</p>
<p>Based on this example here, you can access the app as follows : <code>http://your-site/flaskroot/helloworld</code></p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>Original video by improvement pill on how to keep the conversation flowing. Basically, these are the topics during the conversation. These topics can go deep and can create &#8220;emotional touch&#8221; between you and the other person.</p>
<p>This is part of my note collection and commentary.</p>
<p><strong>F. Family.</strong></p>
<p>Start with your own family. Once you open up, redirect the family related question to the other person. This way he/she wont feel reluctant to talk</p>
<p>Example : I live in a big family. Arguing with siblings has become part of my daily life. How about you? How many siblings do you have?</p>
<p><strong>O. Occupation.</strong></p>
<p>Can use the technique of opening up first and then ask related question. Comment on his/her answer and then ask question. Do not ask question upon question with no commentaries in between questions. You will sound like a police !</p>
<p><strong>R. Recreation.</strong></p>
<p>Try to connect with him/her with his/her hobbies. For example &#8211; How I wish I can take photos like you did !! Teach me your secret!</p>
<p><strong>D. Dreams.</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t go directly to dream questions. Use previous 3 topics to lead to dream questions.</p>
<p>I notice that there are some common techniques when talking about these topics :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open up first and then ask related questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comment on their answers before asking next questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make &#8220;positive assumption&#8221; statement about the person to get the conversation flowing. (Cold reading technique) E.g. from the way you sit, I believe you are a very disciplined person.</p>
</li>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><h2>Problem:</h2>
<p>I wiped clean my Linux partition on my hard disk. I never thought there would be any problem. To my horror, when I tried to boot my laptop, I couldn&#8217;t even get into my Windows at all. I received Grub Rescue prompt during booting up. Trying some tips from the Internet to no avail.</p>
<h2>Solution:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Luckily, there was a Ubuntu Mate live CD within reach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changed boot order to boot from live CD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the command line, run boot-repair program but still no luck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-installed back Ubuntu Mate on my previous partition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, I could access my Windows back during booting up!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was not the best solution but still accomplished my objective to access my Windows. I didn&#8217;t have any Windows Repair media with me. Tried to create one but failed. Don&#8217;t know why.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lessons Learnt:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do not simply erase Linux partition. You might accidentally erase Grub. Find out more about your Grub boot loader&#8217;s location before wiping your Linux partition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have your Linux live CD with you. With this CD, you can still access the contents of your hard disk in case you couldn&#8217;t boot using your hard disk.</p>

<p><strong>1. Find a topic.</strong> Study it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Explain the topic</strong> either by writing it on paper or verbal explanation to your friends using your own words.</p>
<p>For the best result, write and talk about the topic. If you have no one to explain to, talk to yourself while imagining you are teaching someone.</p>
<p><strong>3. Simplify the explanation</strong> If you truly understand the subject, you will have no problem to explain it in simpler way.</p>
<p>Cut the words. Use analogy. Use drawings. Explain to your audience like they are kids.</p>

<h2>7 Actions For Fast Language Acquisition</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Listen a lot. He called this listening process &#8211; brain soaking. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you understand them or not. Just keep listening to the spoken language &#8211; conversations, songs, videos. You unconsciously expose yourself to the structures of the language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on getting the meaning first (before the words). Aim for comprehension. Try to understand through the body language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start mixing the words that you already know.  Make variety of known words combinations to communicate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on the core. If the language has 10000 words,  perhaps only 2000 &#8211; 3000 that matters i.e. that are regularly used. This is the core. Focus on this collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get a language parent. Find a native speaker friend that can guide and give feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy the face. See how the native speaker speaks the words and follow how they say them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct connect to mental images. When you try to memorize any new word, form a mental picture of that word and make it multisensory experience (in your head!)</p>
</li>
</ol>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>​Notes from the TEDx talk @ Lingnan University by Chris Lonsdale</p>
<p>Youtube link : <a href="https://youtu.be/d0yGdNEWdn0">How To Learn Any Language in 6 Months video</a></p>
<p>This my commentary/notes based on that talk. Great talk. Check it out.</p>
<p>The title of the video to me is a bit hype. Doable if you put the time and effort. Regardless how fast you learn &#8211; 6 months or more, the principles and actions are solid and applicable to learn almost anything.</p>
<h2>Some of the key points :</h2>
<p>1- Modelling. This is a powerful concept of achieving something. Observe what works and follow them. Use the working model as your base to get started. Improvise/adjust accordingly based on the results feedback.</p>
<p>2- Attention, relevance, meaning and memory are all interrelated</p>
<p>3- We master tools when they are the most relevant to us i.e. that we always use</p>
<h2>5 Principles of Fast Language Learning</h2>
<p><strong>1- Focus on language content that is relevant to you</strong></p>
<p>Language is a very broad domain. You&#8217;ll be overwhelmed by the vastness of the topics to be covered when  learning new language. Most of the time, this overwhelming feeling will demotivate and lead to inaction.</p>
<p>Focusing on the relevance will remove the &#8216;noise&#8217; and lead to faster comprehension and longer memory retention.</p>
<p><strong>2- Use the language as a tool to communicate</strong></p>
<p>Communication is the best way to master any language. You don&#8217;t get good just by writing or talking to yourself.</p>
<p>You need to go out there and try to deliver your message using your new language, assisted by whatever means you have to get the other side to understand you. This includes body language, hand gestures, drawing, etc.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you stumble a lot at the beginning. That&#8217;s good. It means you are trying to get your message across.</p>
<p>Babies are not perfect communicators but they surely manage to get the parents understand them. You are just like them at this early stage.</p>
<p><strong>3- When you understand the message, you will unconsciously acquire the language</strong></p>
<p>Comprehension will strengthen your language acquisation and retention. Aim to understand the message, no matter how different is the new language sentence&#8217;s structure compared to your mother tongue&#8217;s</p>
<p><strong>4- Physiological training</strong></span></p>
<p>Move your mouth. Say it outloud. Flex your tongue. Shout. Curse outloud. Ok that last part is a bit too much.</p>
<p><strong>5- Emotional states affect learning</strong></p>
<p>Learn when you are in positive mood &#8211; happy, excited, grateful, etc. Better retention. Stressfull learning process will distance you away from what you are trying to learn.</p>
<p>I will continue with 7 actions in the next post.</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><h3>Objective :</h3>
<p>To prevent displaying full post on homepage/archive/category/tag pages. Display only excerpt of the full post on these pages.</p>
<p>From user&#8217;s perspective, they don&#8217;t want to scroll each full post on these pages. They want to read only the one they choose. What&#8217;s the point of displaying full post for all the posts on these types of pages ?</p>
<h3>Solutions :</h3>
<p><strong>1&#46; Manually break the post</strong></p>
<p>If you use editor in WordPress, you will notice a horizontal symbol in the editor&#8217;s toolbar. You can break your post by placing this break anywhere you want in the post.</p>
<p>On homepage/archive/category/tag pages, only portion before the break will be displayed. No more full post on these pages. Full post will only be shown when you go directly to the post page.</p>
<p>The drawback &#8211; you have to do this every time you write a new post unless you find a way to automate the process.</p>
<p><strong>2&#46; Use the_excerpt()</strong></p>
<p>On homepage/archive/category/tag pages, you&#8217;ll normally find a <code>have_posts()</code> loop to list down all the posts on these pages. After <code>the_post()</code> line, you can add <code>the_excerpt()</code>.</p>
<p>The excerpt doesn&#8217;t give the title post &#8211; only an excerpt of the post and link to continue reading. You need to add the title of the post.</p>
<p>I have done that below. You might want to add extras like dates, categories, tags &#8211; depending on what you want to have listed for each post.</p>
<p><code>&lt;?php&lt;br /&gt;
 while ( have_posts() ) :&lt;br /&gt;
    the_post(); ?&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="&lt;?php the_permalink(); ?&gt;"&gt;&lt;?php the_title() ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;?php&lt;br /&gt;
     the_excerpt();&lt;br /&gt;
 endwhile; ?&gt;</code></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>Apparantly, after studying the template codes, there is a much easier way to get around this. This is a theme-dependent code, hence please have a look at your code. I&#8217;m working on Twenty Seventeen theme.</p>
<p>Firstly, remove all the amendments from previous method.</p>
<p>Please find this line in index.php and archive.php :</p>
<p><code>get_template_part( 'template-parts/post/content', get_post_format() );</code></p>
<p>If you look into <code>template-parts/post/</code> folder, you will notice that the brilliant theme developers have already done this for you. They have already created template for excerpt type listing.</p>
<p>What you need to do is, change the above line to this :</p>
<p><code>get_template_part( 'template-parts/post/content-excerpt', get_post_format() );</code></p>
<p>See? Just a small edit ! (^_^)</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>I&#8217;m always impressed by those who can churn lots of long form essays regularly. How did they do it? I have no idea. </p>
<p>To write such a long essay on any particular topic is one thing, to do it regularly is another thing.</p>
<p>No doubt, the ability to write long form essays comes with practice. Not only that, you have to read a lot. Then you have some ideas on what to write.</p>
<p>Articulating any idea is a skill that can be achieved through long form essays. This is one of the objective of this site. </p>
<p>I might not be able to produce 1000 words essay in one sitting but at least I keep writing on various ideas to flex my train of thoughts to a point where I can do it quickly. </p>
<p>The act of reading is an act of consumption. It does give you some kind of entertainment or fulfillment but no act of consumption can ever beat the satisfaction feeling produced by the act of producing. </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">This is where writing falls into &#8211; an act of producing, which gives a tremendous amount of satisfaction and fulfillment. </span> Gone were the days where writing long form essays was the second nature to me. Those were the school days. 20 years back.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll revive this habit. It can be done. Regular writings. Here. Now. 2017.</p>

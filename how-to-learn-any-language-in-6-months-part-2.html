</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on getting the meaning first (before the words). Aim for comprehension. Try to understand through the body language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start mixing the words that you already know.  Make variety of known words combinations to communicate</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Get a language parent. Find a native speaker friend that can guide and give feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy the face. See how the native speaker speaks the words and follow how they say them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct connect to mental images. When you try to memorize any new word, form a mental picture of that word and make it multisensory experience (in your head!)</p>
</li>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>There were times when I felt I wanted to walk instead of running. It's not that I didn't have the energy to run. My legs were still capable to keep running. But why, I decided to walk instead of run ?</p>
<p>It comes down to motivation, self-discipline and goal</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>Why do you want to keep running ? Is it because you want to complete within the given time for the medal ? Or is it because you want to beat your personal record ? Or perhaps you have your own personal reason ? Find that motivation and remind yourself of that movitation whenever you feel want to stop.</p>
<p><strong>Self-discipline</strong></p>
<p>For some reasons, your might feel demotivated at certain points during the run. At this point, the only thing that will push you is your self-discipline. You don't stop no matter what because you are one hell of disciplined running mice. You have to run whether you like it or otherwise. Reminding yourself of your strong self-discipline definitely will help.</p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<p>One common area in both of the factors is you need some kind of goal. Without the goal, you have nothing to look forward to. Without the goal, no amount of motivation or self-discipline will keep you moving.</p>
<p>All these areas are applicable to life in general.</p>
<p>To keep going in life, you'll need a goal, some motivation and one hell of self-discipline.</p>

<li>Event : Kuala Lumpur City Day Run 2017 </li>
<li>Location : Padang Merbok route </li>
<li>Date : 26th Feb 2017 </li>
<li>Start time : 730am </li>
<li>Weather : Raining in the beginning</li>
</ul>
<h2>Review</h2>
<p>Somehow, I felt this was my worst outdoor running event but yet for some miracle, I did manage to get my best time for this event.</p>
<p>In my previous event, my average pace was 7&#8217;35&#8221; min/km. This new event however I managed to get 7&#8217;08&#8221; min/km</p>
<p>Some reflections on this run :</p>
<p><strong>1&#46; Running in the rain sucks.</strong> This was my first time running in the rain. It seems more energy was needed to run in this condition &#8211; to get rid of stressful feeling running wet, to carry water drenched clothes, to keep your face clear from rain water distraction while running</p>
<p><strong>2&#46; Hilly run.</strong> I was not expecting something like this &#8211; too many uphills. I walked for all the uphills. If I were to run again on this route, I might be mentally prepared on what should I do. My advice &#8211; for uphill run, try to continuously run (slow is OK) but if you can&#8217;t, do short bursts. But for downhill: don&#8217;t stop, keep running with long stride. This is the key to get better average pace.</p>
<p><strong>3&#46; Motivation to continuously run.</strong> During my previous run, the only thing that kept me running continuously was my desire to get the finisher medal and hence I must run within the time limit for the medal. I had no previous reference so I was so scared I might not make it which led to continuos run in the past event.</p>
<p>However, this time was different. I knew, no matter the completion time, I&#8217;ll get the medal. The only question was &#8211; can I finish within 1 hour 30 mins for E-Cert. To run within this time limitation was the only motivation I had.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to many uphills, I was demotivated and thought that I might not make it which led to &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t be bothered. This led to lots of walking compared to previous event.</p>
<p>I kept going though so that at least I was not that far off from the time limit. To my surprise, I did manage to run 12km within the time limit.</p>
<p>I knew I was more than capable to do better because during the final 1km, I could still run strongly with long stride.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a good experience to run on hilly Padang Merbok route.</p>
<p>Until next time !</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>It was not really a total misery but still it&#8217;s a fucked up month compared to others. During the whole February, I felt something was off. I was kinda rebellious. I wanted to do something different from of my routine. I simply wanted to quit.</p>
<p>Hence, no strict rule of eating during the whole month, which led to bad diet and weight gain. The workout/exercise was still OK. I managed to keep my exercise for most of the weeks. I did miss 1 or 2 days for certain weeks but it was still OK for my standard.</p>
<p>This whole &#8220;off mood&#8221; scenario seems to be caused by certain factors :</p>
<p><strong>1- No significant weight loss</strong> Weight loss was my biggest motivator to keep me going. I knew I could reduce at least 1kg per week. However, lately, it seems that&#8217;s a bit hard to achieve. Sometimes, I felt I had reached a plateau.</p>
<p>This led me to disappointment and hence rebellious act &#8211; the fuck do I care what I am gonna eat.</p>
<p><strong>2- Broken weight scale</strong> My old weight scale was not responsive anymore. Hence, I went to look for reliable scale. Bought a new one, but the new one seems to be showing varying readings depending on where I put the scale.</p>
<p>I was obsessed with the accuracy and this new scale didn&#8217;t live up to my expectation. Another dissapointment which led to &#8211; the fuck with the weight attitude.</p>
<p><strong>3- Boredom</strong> Routine is boring. I had been doing the same routine for few months already. I needed to vent somewhere which led to &#8211; the fuck with the all these routines, I&#8217;ll do whatever I want.</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>To tackle this challenge, I have come out with the following solutions :</p>
<p><strong>1- Fuck obsession with the weight readings</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m doing right now. Instead of focusing on the weight readings, I should change my focus to my activity. Let&#8217;s just eat right and keep exercising. Slowly, the results will take care itself.</p>
<p><strong>2- If it&#8217;s right, keep doing it</strong> If you have been exercising all this while, why do have to feel dissapointed when there is no result ? Fuck result. Focus on the process and activity.</p>
<p><strong>3- Lifestyle</strong> This is the ultimate solution. Turn your good habit into lifetyle. No matter the result. Lifestyle will keep you going whenever you face any adversary.</p>
<p><strong>4- No more &#8220;it&#8217;s just this one time&#8221; attitude</strong> This same excuse or some sort of similar excuse has plagued those who want to change for the better. Truth is, this is just an excuse you tell yourself to do what you shouldn&#8217;t do in the first place. You just want to avoid that guilty feeling. That&#8217;s all.</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>Rejection is emotionally painful. It can lead to all sort of negative feelings &#8211; sad, angry, disappointment, embarrassment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these feelings will influence your action, your attitude, your response to the world around you.</p>
<p>If you allow yourself to respond negatively to these emotions, you will always be in a losing position. Your emotion won&#8217;t get stronger.</p>
<p>In order to change this, you need to continuously expose yourself to the rejections and at the same time you control how you respond to the situations.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll train your emotion to adapt to the rejections. Over time, you will be calmer, more relaxed, less temper when facing the rejections.</p>
<p>After a while, rejection won&#8217;t intimidate you anymore. You&#8217;ll feel &#8216;mehhh&#8217; and you move on. At this point, you will be unstoppable. No rejection can change your emotion.</p>
<p>Those with muscular body or incredible strength don&#8217;t simply get big or strong overnight. It takes time and lots of exercise.</p>
<p>The same goes with your emotion. Get rejected often. Control how your respond. Strengthen your emotion.</p>
<p>Soon, you will be unstoppable.</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>I&#8217;m always impressed by those who can churn lots of long form essays regularly. How did they do it? I have no idea. </p>
<p>To write such a long essay on any particular topic is one thing, to do it regularly is another thing.</p>
<p>No doubt, the ability to write long form essays comes with practice. Not only that, you have to read a lot. Then you have some ideas on what to write.</p>
<p>Articulating any idea is a skill that can be achieved through long form essays. This is one of the objective of this site. </p>
<p>I might not be able to produce 1000 words essay in one sitting but at least I keep writing on various ideas to flex my train of thoughts to a point where I can do it quickly. </p>
<p>The act of reading is an act of consumption. It does give you some kind of entertainment or fulfillment but no act of consumption can ever beat the satisfaction feeling produced by the act of producing. </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">This is where writing falls into &#8211; an act of producing, which gives a tremendous amount of satisfaction and fulfillment. </span> Gone were the days where writing long form essays was the second nature to me. Those were the school days. 20 years back.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll revive this habit. It can be done. Regular writings. Here. Now. 2017.</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>Friday the 13th? Coincidence?</p>
<p>Remember this date &#8211; Friday 13th Jan 2017. This was the day this site was borned into the cyber world.</p>
<p>I was planning to blog on the Python based website. But damn son, it was so complicated.</p>
<p>I did manage to put up a Mezzanine CMS after failing to set up Django CMS. Still, the process of tweaking the theme or adding independent links seem to be pain in the ass.</p>
<p>Listen &#8211; I just need a decent enough site for my content management.</p>
<p>It seems to me that at the end of the day, good ol&#8217; WordPress was the one that I can rely upon, despite all the bloats that WordPress is associated nowadays.</p>

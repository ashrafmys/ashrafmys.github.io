</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>3 main types of the hand gesture, each with different type of influence.</p>
<p>Use it depending on the situation or intention of your talk :</p>
<p><strong>1. Palm face up</strong> &#8211; to be more persuasive, to influence the crowd to accept the presented idea</p>
<p><strong>2. Palm face down</strong> &#8211; to show power and authority, to subtly exert power over the audience to &#8220;follow&#8221; your idea</p>
<p><strong>3. Finger pointing</strong> &#8211; worst of all, don&#8217;t use it. It&#8217;s a rude way to tell something to someone.</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p><strong>1. Be proactive</strong> Focus your energy on what you can control &#8211; your circle of influence. Things that are out of your control (your circle of concerns) should be the least priority in your mind.</p>
<p><strong>2. Begin with the end in mind</strong> This is the big picture view of everything. You do something because it&#8217;s related to your end goal. Having end goal in mind lets you prioritize your task. The goal helps you to creatively develop and find the &#8220;required&#8221; tasks to achieve your goals.</p>
<p><strong>3. Put first things first</strong> All the tasks that you perform can be categorized into 4 quadrants. The priority of the tasks should be in the following order : Not urgent, but important &gt; Urgent, important &gt; Urgent, not important &gt; Not urgent, not important</p>
<p><strong>4. Think win/win</strong> This is the ultimate relationship goal. All involved parties benefit from the relationship. The relationship flourishes and all involved parties would do anything to keep the relationship going.</p>
<p><strong>5. Seek first to understand, then to be understood</strong> This is the key to the effective communication. You have to listen and understand your audience before you try to deliver your message. Once you understand their reasons from their perspective, then you can adapt your message to their situation so that you can be understood.</p>
<p><strong>6. Synergize</strong> This refers to putting together all the available resources and optimize their capabilities to achieve the best possible output. In simple words- work together, complement each other, strategize and optimize the capabilities .</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>Writing is not easy especially when you need to convey a complicated idea in an uncomplicated way.</p>
<p>Your brain needs to form coherent sentences, not to mention coherent ideas or train of thoughts to get to the point.</p>
<p>Otherwise, your reader will lose interest to continue reading, leaving the main idea &#8220;untouched&#8221;. Too bad, failed writing communication.</p>
<p>This whole process will require sound executive brain function. Writing will make you to think hard.</p>
<p>To some, writing is like solving puzzle. You need to figure out how to put all the pieces together so that you can show the big picture at the end of your final piece.</p>
<p>My main motivation behind writing is solely to get my brain working hard to produce articulate idea.</p>
<p>I am not a good writer but I do know what practice can do. Over a year period, if I keep doing what I am doing I will see a huge change.</p>
<p>Consistent is the key. To be consistent, a reminder is a must &#8211; at least at the beginning stage.</p>
<p>Once it turns into a habit, you&#8217;ll be unstoppable. You will feel something is missing or something is not right if you don&#8217;t do it.</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>The talk by Dave Fontenot @ TedXTeen : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VakF2hZFPQ">Hack your life in 48 hours</a></p>
<p>Key points from this talk :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dedicate a few days to build something. 2 &#8211; 3 days is good enough. Block out everything else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t code, just join the hackathon around you to get the exposure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is no hackathon around you, start small with friends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build something you want to build regardless your knowledge level. If you don&#8217;t know, get help through Google or friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The end product doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect. Doesn&#8217;t have to be full pledge big product either. Functional is good enough.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>My personal view on this:</strong></p>
<p>Hackathon is a good culture to develop more builders, inventors, creators. Here, we are conditioned to be consumers instead of creators. As a result, we ,as a nation, are highly dependable on the tech creator nations. Simply put, we are at their mercy.</p>
<p>To change this consumer mentality, leaders of this country has to steer the direction of the country towards innovation. It has to be done by those who care about the fate of this country.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it will be another messy corruption behind the name of &#8220;developing the nation&#8221;</p>
<p>This is how Japan changed from shogunate to modernization. The starting point of this change was during Meiji restoration era.</p>
<p>The political power was restored to the emperor from the shogun. Once in power, the emperor did what was necessary to modernize Japan and consequently turn Japan into an independent nation.</p>
<p>This can be done &#8211; if everyone in this country actually <strong>cares</strong> about this country</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>The notes are based on his talk. Watch his video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK1nMQq67VI">here</a></p>
<p>These points are basically from his book Brain Rules. He only talked a few of them in this video.</p>
<p>Some of the key points from the video :</p>
<p>1- The brain is designed to solve problem related to <strong>surviving</strong>, in unstable outdoor environment and to do so in constant motion</p>
<p>2- Exercise boosts brain power.</p>
<p><strong>Aerobic exercise</strong> can significantly improve executive function of the brain. Weight lifting however doesn&#8217;t seem to improve this function.</p>
<p>Both aerobic &amp; weight lifting doesn&#8217;t enhance the memory function.</p>
<p>Exercise specifically aerobic exercise can reduce cognitive pathology (depression, dimentia, etc)</p>
<p>How much exercise to get cognitive improvement? <strong>2 &#8211; 3 times a week of 20 minutes aerobic exercise</strong></p>
<p>3- Stressed brains don&#8217;t learn the same way as unstressed brain. Stress can &#8216;damage&#8217; the brain. The more stress you feel, the less productive you&#8217;ll be.</p>
<p><strong>Relax and learn</strong></p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>Original video by improvement pill on how to keep the conversation flowing. Basically, these are the topics during the conversation. These topics can go deep and can create &#8220;emotional touch&#8221; between you and the other person.</p>
<p>This is part of my note collection and commentary.</p>
<p><strong>F. Family.</strong></p>
<p>Start with your own family. Once you open up, redirect the family related question to the other person. This way he/she wont feel reluctant to talk</p>
<p>Example : I live in a big family. Arguing with siblings has become part of my daily life. How about you? How many siblings do you have?</p>
<p><strong>O. Occupation.</strong></p>
<p>Can use the technique of opening up first and then ask related question. Comment on his/her answer and then ask question. Do not ask question upon question with no commentaries in between questions. You will sound like a police !</p>
<p><strong>R. Recreation.</strong></p>
<p>Try to connect with him/her with his/her hobbies. For example &#8211; How I wish I can take photos like you did !! Teach me your secret!</p>
<p><strong>D. Dreams.</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t go directly to dream questions. Use previous 3 topics to lead to dream questions.</p>
<p>I notice that there are some common techniques when talking about these topics :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open up first and then ask related questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comment on their answers before asking next questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make &#8220;positive assumption&#8221; statement about the person to get the conversation flowing. (Cold reading technique) E.g. from the way you sit, I believe you are a very disciplined person.</p>
</li>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><h2>Problem:</h2>
<p>I wiped clean my Linux partition on my hard disk. I never thought there would be any problem. To my horror, when I tried to boot my laptop, I couldn&#8217;t even get into my Windows at all. I received Grub Rescue prompt during booting up. Trying some tips from the Internet to no avail.</p>
<h2>Solution:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Luckily, there was a Ubuntu Mate live CD within reach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changed boot order to boot from live CD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the command line, run boot-repair program but still no luck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-installed back Ubuntu Mate on my previous partition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, I could access my Windows back during booting up!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was not the best solution but still accomplished my objective to access my Windows. I didn&#8217;t have any Windows Repair media with me. Tried to create one but failed. Don&#8217;t know why.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lessons Learnt:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do not simply erase Linux partition. You might accidentally erase Grub. Find out more about your Grub boot loader&#8217;s location before wiping your Linux partition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have your Linux live CD with you. With this CD, you can still access the contents of your hard disk in case you couldn&#8217;t boot using your hard disk.</p>

<p>A famous physicist who won Nobel prize. He was really a funny guy. You should read or listen to his book &#8211; You Must Be Joking Mr Feynman. Great book !</p>
<h2>The Feynman Technique</h2>
<p><strong>1. Find a topic.</strong> Study it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Explain the topic</strong> either by writing it on paper or verbal explanation to your friends using your own words.</p>
<p>For the best result, write and talk about the topic. If you have no one to explain to, talk to yourself while imagining you are teaching someone.</p>
<p><strong>3. Simplify the explanation</strong> If you truly understand the subject, you will have no problem to explain it in simpler way.</p>
<p>Cut the words. Use analogy. Use drawings. Explain to your audience like they are kids.</p>

<h2>7 Actions For Fast Language Acquisition</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Listen a lot. He called this listening process &#8211; brain soaking. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you understand them or not. Just keep listening to the spoken language &#8211; conversations, songs, videos. You unconsciously expose yourself to the structures of the language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on getting the meaning first (before the words). Aim for comprehension. Try to understand through the body language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start mixing the words that you already know.  Make variety of known words combinations to communicate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on the core. If the language has 10000 words,  perhaps only 2000 &#8211; 3000 that matters i.e. that are regularly used. This is the core. Focus on this collection.</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>​Notes from the TEDx talk @ Lingnan University by Chris Lonsdale</p>
<p>Youtube link : <a href="https://youtu.be/d0yGdNEWdn0">How To Learn Any Language in 6 Months video</a></p>
<p>This my commentary/notes based on that talk. Great talk. Check it out.</p>
<p>The title of the video to me is a bit hype. Doable if you put the time and effort. Regardless how fast you learn &#8211; 6 months or more, the principles and actions are solid and applicable to learn almost anything.</p>
<h2>Some of the key points :</h2>
<p>1- Modelling. This is a powerful concept of achieving something. Observe what works and follow them. Use the working model as your base to get started. Improvise/adjust accordingly based on the results feedback.</p>
<p>2- Attention, relevance, meaning and memory are all interrelated</p>
<p>3- We master tools when they are the most relevant to us i.e. that we always use</p>
<h2>5 Principles of Fast Language Learning</h2>
<p><strong>1- Focus on language content that is relevant to you</strong></p>
<p>Language is a very broad domain. You&#8217;ll be overwhelmed by the vastness of the topics to be covered when  learning new language. Most of the time, this overwhelming feeling will demotivate and lead to inaction.</p>
<p>Focusing on the relevance will remove the &#8216;noise&#8217; and lead to faster comprehension and longer memory retention.</p>
<p><strong>2- Use the language as a tool to communicate</strong></p>
<p>Communication is the best way to master any language. You don&#8217;t get good just by writing or talking to yourself.</p>
<p>You need to go out there and try to deliver your message using your new language, assisted by whatever means you have to get the other side to understand you. This includes body language, hand gestures, drawing, etc.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you stumble a lot at the beginning. That&#8217;s good. It means you are trying to get your message across.</p>
<p>Babies are not perfect communicators but they surely manage to get the parents understand them. You are just like them at this early stage.</p>
<p><strong>3- When you understand the message, you will unconsciously acquire the language</strong></p>
<p>Comprehension will strengthen your language acquisation and retention. Aim to understand the message, no matter how different is the new language sentence&#8217;s structure compared to your mother tongue&#8217;s</p>
<p><strong>4- Physiological training</strong></span></p>
<p>Move your mouth. Say it outloud. Flex your tongue. Shout. Curse outloud. Ok that last part is a bit too much.</p>
<p><strong>5- Emotional states affect learning</strong></p>
<p>Learn when you are in positive mood &#8211; happy, excited, grateful, etc. Better retention. Stressfull learning process will distance you away from what you are trying to learn.</p>
<p>I will continue with 7 actions in the next post.</p>

    <p>Rejection is emotionally painful. It can lead to all sort of negative feelings &#8211; sad, angry, disappointment, embarrassment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these feelings will influence your action, your attitude, your response to the world around you.</p>
<p>If you allow yourself to respond negatively to these emotions, you will always be in a losing position. Your emotion won&#8217;t get stronger.</p>
<p>In order to change this, you need to continuously expose yourself to the rejections and at the same time you control how you respond to the situations.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll train your emotion to adapt to the rejections. Over time, you will be calmer, more relaxed, less temper when facing the rejections.</p>
<p>After a while, rejection won&#8217;t intimidate you anymore. You&#8217;ll feel &#8216;mehhh&#8217; and you move on. At this point, you will be unstoppable. No rejection can change your emotion.</p>
<p>Those with muscular body or incredible strength don&#8217;t simply get big or strong overnight. It takes time and lots of exercise.</p>
<p>The same goes with your emotion. Get rejected often. Control how your respond. Strengthen your emotion.</p>

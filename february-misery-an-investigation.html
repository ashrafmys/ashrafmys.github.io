    <p>It was not really a total misery but still it&#8217;s a fucked up month compared to others. During the whole February, I felt something was off. I was kinda rebellious. I wanted to do something different from of my routine. I simply wanted to quit.</p>
<p>Hence, no strict rule of eating during the whole month, which led to bad diet and weight gain. The workout/exercise was still OK. I managed to keep my exercise for most of the weeks. I did miss 1 or 2 days for certain weeks but it was still OK for my standard.</p>
<p>This whole &#8220;off mood&#8221; scenario seems to be caused by certain factors :</p>
<p><strong>1- No significant weight loss</strong> Weight loss was my biggest motivator to keep me going. I knew I could reduce at least 1kg per week. However, lately, it seems that&#8217;s a bit hard to achieve. Sometimes, I felt I had reached a plateau.</p>
<p>This led me to disappointment and hence rebellious act &#8211; the fuck do I care what I am gonna eat.</p>
<p><strong>2- Broken weight scale</strong> My old weight scale was not responsive anymore. Hence, I went to look for reliable scale. Bought a new one, but the new one seems to be showing varying readings depending on where I put the scale.</p>
<p>I was obsessed with the accuracy and this new scale didn&#8217;t live up to my expectation. Another dissapointment which led to &#8211; the fuck with the weight attitude.</p>
<p><strong>3- Boredom</strong> Routine is boring. I had been doing the same routine for few months already. I needed to vent somewhere which led to &#8211; the fuck with the all these routines, I&#8217;ll do whatever I want.</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>To tackle this challenge, I have come out with the following solutions :</p>
<p><strong>1- Fuck obsession with the weight readings</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m doing right now. Instead of focusing on the weight readings, I should change my focus to my activity. Let&#8217;s just eat right and keep exercising. Slowly, the results will take care itself.</p>
<p><strong>2- If it&#8217;s right, keep doing it</strong> If you have been exercising all this while, why do have to feel dissapointed when there is no result ? Fuck result. Focus on the process and activity.</p>
<p><strong>3- Lifestyle</strong> This is the ultimate solution. Turn your good habit into lifetyle. No matter the result. Lifestyle will keep you going whenever you face any adversary.</p>
<p><strong>4- No more &#8220;it&#8217;s just this one time&#8221; attitude</strong> This same excuse or some sort of similar excuse has plagued those who want to change for the better. Truth is, this is just an excuse you tell yourself to do what you shouldn&#8217;t do in the first place. You just want to avoid that guilty feeling. That&#8217;s all.</p>

	<h6>Fri, 27 Jan 2017 @ <a href="/category/general-notes.html">General Notes</a>
	</h6>

    <p>The notes are based on his talk. Watch his video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK1nMQq67VI">here</a></p>
<p>These points are basically from his book Brain Rules. He only talked a few of them in this video.</p>
<p>Some of the key points from the video :</p>
<p>1- The brain is designed to solve problem related to <strong>surviving</strong>, in unstable outdoor environment and to do so in constant motion</p>
<p>2- Exercise boosts brain power.</p>
<p><strong>Aerobic exercise</strong> can significantly improve executive function of the brain. Weight lifting however doesn&#8217;t seem to improve this function.</p>
<p>Both aerobic &amp; weight lifting doesn&#8217;t enhance the memory function.</p>
<p>Exercise specifically aerobic exercise can reduce cognitive pathology (depression, dimentia, etc)</p>
<p>How much exercise to get cognitive improvement? <strong>2 &#8211; 3 times a week of 20 minutes aerobic exercise</strong></p>
<p>3- Stressed brains don&#8217;t learn the same way as unstressed brain. Stress can &#8216;damage&#8217; the brain. The more stress you feel, the less productive you&#8217;ll be.</p>
<p><strong>Relax and learn</strong></p>

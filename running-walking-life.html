</div><!-- /.post-info -->          <p>There were times when I felt I wanted to walk instead of running. It's not that I didn't have the energy to run. My legs were still capable to keep running. But why, I decided to walk instead of run ?</p>
<p>It comes down to motivation, self-discipline and goal</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>Why do you want to keep running ? Is it because you want to complete within the given time for the medal ? Or is it because you want to beat your personal record ? Or perhaps you have your own personal reason ? Find that motivation and remind yourself of that movitation whenever you feel want to stop.</p>
<p><strong>Self-discipline</strong></p>
<p>For some reasons, your might feel demotivated at certain points during the run. At this point, the only thing that will push you is your self-discipline. You don't stop no matter what because you are one hell of disciplined running mice. You have to run whether you like it or otherwise. Reminding yourself of your strong self-discipline definitely will help.</p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<p>One common area in both of the factors is you need some kind of goal. Without the goal, you have nothing to look forward to. Without the goal, no amount of motivation or self-discipline will keep you moving.</p>
<p>All these areas are applicable to life in general.</p>
<p>To keep going in life, you'll need a goal, some motivation and one hell of self-discipline.</p>

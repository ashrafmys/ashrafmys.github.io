    <p>I&#8217;m always impressed by those who can churn lots of long form essays regularly. How did they do it? I have no idea. </p>
<p>To write such a long essay on any particular topic is one thing, to do it regularly is another thing.</p>
<p>No doubt, the ability to write long form essays comes with practice. Not only that, you have to read a lot. Then you have some ideas on what to write.</p>
<p>Articulating any idea is a skill that can be achieved through long form essays. This is one of the objective of this site. </p>
<p>I might not be able to produce 1000 words essay in one sitting but at least I keep writing on various ideas to flex my train of thoughts to a point where I can do it quickly. </p>
<p>The act of reading is an act of consumption. It does give you some kind of entertainment or fulfillment but no act of consumption can ever beat the satisfaction feeling produced by the act of producing. </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">This is where writing falls into &#8211; an act of producing, which gives a tremendous amount of satisfaction and fulfillment. </span> Gone were the days where writing long form essays was the second nature to me. Those were the school days. 20 years back.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll revive this habit. It can be done. Regular writings. Here. Now. 2017.</p>

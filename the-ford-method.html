    <p>Original video by improvement pill on how to keep the conversation flowing. Basically, these are the topics during the conversation. These topics can go deep and can create &#8220;emotional touch&#8221; between you and the other person.</p>
<p>This is part of my note collection and commentary.</p>
<p><strong>F. Family.</strong></p>
<p>Start with your own family. Once you open up, redirect the family related question to the other person. This way he/she wont feel reluctant to talk</p>
<p>Example : I live in a big family. Arguing with siblings has become part of my daily life. How about you? How many siblings do you have?</p>
<p><strong>O. Occupation.</strong></p>
<p>Can use the technique of opening up first and then ask related question. Comment on his/her answer and then ask question. Do not ask question upon question with no commentaries in between questions. You will sound like a police !</p>
<p><strong>R. Recreation.</strong></p>
<p>Try to connect with him/her with his/her hobbies. For example &#8211; How I wish I can take photos like you did !! Teach me your secret!</p>
<p><strong>D. Dreams.</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t go directly to dream questions. Use previous 3 topics to lead to dream questions.</p>
<p>I notice that there are some common techniques when talking about these topics :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open up first and then ask related questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comment on their answers before asking next questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make &#8220;positive assumption&#8221; statement about the person to get the conversation flowing. (Cold reading technique) E.g. from the way you sit, I believe you are a very disciplined person.</p>
</li>
</ol>

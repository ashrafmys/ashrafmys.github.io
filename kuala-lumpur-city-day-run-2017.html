<h2>Review</h2>
<p>Somehow, I felt this was my worst outdoor running event but yet for some miracle, I did manage to get my best time for this event.</p>
<p>In my previous event, my average pace was 7&#8217;35&#8221; min/km. This new event however I managed to get 7&#8217;08&#8221; min/km</p>
<p>Some reflections on this run :</p>
<p><strong>1&#46; Running in the rain sucks.</strong> This was my first time running in the rain. It seems more energy was needed to run in this condition &#8211; to get rid of stressful feeling running wet, to carry water drenched clothes, to keep your face clear from rain water distraction while running</p>
<p><strong>2&#46; Hilly run.</strong> I was not expecting something like this &#8211; too many uphills. I walked for all the uphills. If I were to run again on this route, I might be mentally prepared on what should I do. My advice &#8211; for uphill run, try to continuously run (slow is OK) but if you can&#8217;t, do short bursts. But for downhill: don&#8217;t stop, keep running with long stride. This is the key to get better average pace.</p>
<p><strong>3&#46; Motivation to continuously run.</strong> During my previous run, the only thing that kept me running continuously was my desire to get the finisher medal and hence I must run within the time limit for the medal. I had no previous reference so I was so scared I might not make it which led to continuos run in the past event.</p>
<p>However, this time was different. I knew, no matter the completion time, I&#8217;ll get the medal. The only question was &#8211; can I finish within 1 hour 30 mins for E-Cert. To run within this time limitation was the only motivation I had.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to many uphills, I was demotivated and thought that I might not make it which led to &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t be bothered. This led to lots of walking compared to previous event.</p>
<p>I kept going though so that at least I was not that far off from the time limit. To my surprise, I did manage to run 12km within the time limit.</p>
<p>I knew I was more than capable to do better because during the final 1km, I could still run strongly with long stride.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a good experience to run on hilly Padang Merbok route.</p>
<p>Until next time !</p>

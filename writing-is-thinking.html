    <p>Writing is not easy especially when you need to convey a complicated idea in an uncomplicated way.</p>
<p>Your brain needs to form coherent sentences, not to mention coherent ideas or train of thoughts to get to the point.</p>
<p>Otherwise, your reader will lose interest to continue reading, leaving the main idea &#8220;untouched&#8221;. Too bad, failed writing communication.</p>
<p>This whole process will require sound executive brain function. Writing will make you to think hard.</p>
<p>To some, writing is like solving puzzle. You need to figure out how to put all the pieces together so that you can show the big picture at the end of your final piece.</p>
<p>My main motivation behind writing is solely to get my brain working hard to produce articulate idea.</p>
<p>I am not a good writer but I do know what practice can do. Over a year period, if I keep doing what I am doing I will see a huge change.</p>
<p>Consistent is the key. To be consistent, a reminder is a must &#8211; at least at the beginning stage.</p>
<p>Once it turns into a habit, you&#8217;ll be unstoppable. You will feel something is missing or something is not right if you don&#8217;t do it.</p>
<p>3 articles a week, on any topic. Lets do this.</p>

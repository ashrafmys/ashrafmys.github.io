    <p>The talk by Dave Fontenot @ TedXTeen : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VakF2hZFPQ">Hack your life in 48 hours</a></p>
<p>Key points from this talk :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dedicate a few days to build something. 2 &#8211; 3 days is good enough. Block out everything else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t code, just join the hackathon around you to get the exposure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is no hackathon around you, start small with friends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build something you want to build regardless your knowledge level. If you don&#8217;t know, get help through Google or friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The end product doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect. Doesn&#8217;t have to be full pledge big product either. Functional is good enough.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>My personal view on this:</strong></p>
<p>Hackathon is a good culture to develop more builders, inventors, creators. Here, we are conditioned to be consumers instead of creators. As a result, we ,as a nation, are highly dependable on the tech creator nations. Simply put, we are at their mercy.</p>
<p>To change this consumer mentality, leaders of this country has to steer the direction of the country towards innovation. It has to be done by those who care about the fate of this country.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it will be another messy corruption behind the name of &#8220;developing the nation&#8221;</p>
<p>This is how Japan changed from shogunate to modernization. The starting point of this change was during Meiji restoration era.</p>
<p>The political power was restored to the emperor from the shogun. Once in power, the emperor did what was necessary to modernize Japan and consequently turn Japan into an independent nation.</p>
<p>This can be done &#8211; if everyone in this country actually <strong>cares</strong> about this country</p>

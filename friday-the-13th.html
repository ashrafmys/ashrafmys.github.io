    <p>Friday the 13th? Coincidence?</p>
<p>Remember this date &#8211; Friday 13th Jan 2017. This was the day this site was borned into the cyber world.</p>
<p>I was planning to blog on the Python based website. But damn son, it was so complicated.</p>
<p>I did manage to put up a Mezzanine CMS after failing to set up Django CMS. Still, the process of tweaking the theme or adding independent links seem to be pain in the ass.</p>
<p>Listen &#8211; I just need a decent enough site for my content management.</p>
<p>It seems to me that at the end of the day, good ol&#8217; WordPress was the one that I can rely upon, despite all the bloats that WordPress is associated nowadays.</p>

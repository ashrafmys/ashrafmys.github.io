        <div><p>​Notes from the TEDx talk @ Lingnan University by Chris Lonsdale</p>
<p>Youtube link : <a href="https://youtu.be/d0yGdNEWdn0">How To Learn Any Language in 6 Months video</a></p>
<p>This my commentary/notes based on that talk. Great talk. Check it out.</p>
<p>The title of the video to me is a bit hype. Doable if you put the time and effort. Regardless how fast you learn &#8211; 6 months or more, the principles and actions are solid and applicable to learn almost anything.</p>
<h2>Some of the key points :</h2>
<p>1- Modelling. This is a powerful concept of achieving something. Observe what works and follow them. Use the working model as your base to get started. Improvise/adjust accordingly based on the results feedback.</p>
<p>2- Attention, relevance, meaning and memory are all interrelated</p>
<p>3- We master tools when they are the most relevant to us i.e. that we always use</p>
<h2>5 Principles of Fast Language Learning</h2>
<p><strong>1- Focus on language content that is relevant to you</strong></p>
<p>Language is a very broad domain. You&#8217;ll be overwhelmed by the vastness of the topics to be covered when  learning new language. Most of the time, this overwhelming feeling will demotivate and lead to inaction.</p>
<p>Focusing on the relevance will remove the &#8216;noise&#8217; and lead to faster comprehension and longer memory retention.</p>
<p><strong>2- Use the language as a tool to communicate</strong></p>
<p>Communication is the best way to master any language. You don&#8217;t get good just by writing or talking to yourself.</p>
<p>You need to go out there and try to deliver your message using your new language, assisted by whatever means you have to get the other side to understand you. This includes body language, hand gestures, drawing, etc.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you stumble a lot at the beginning. That&#8217;s good. It means you are trying to get your message across.</p>
<p>Babies are not perfect communicators but they surely manage to get the parents understand them. You are just like them at this early stage.</p>
<p><strong>3- When you understand the message, you will unconsciously acquire the language</strong></p>
<p>Comprehension will strengthen your language acquisation and retention. Aim to understand the message, no matter how different is the new language sentence&#8217;s structure compared to your mother tongue&#8217;s</p>
<p><strong>4- Physiological training</strong></span></p>
<p>Move your mouth. Say it outloud. Flex your tongue. Shout. Curse outloud. Ok that last part is a bit too much.</p>
<p><strong>5- Emotional states affect learning</strong></p>
<p>Learn when you are in positive mood &#8211; happy, excited, grateful, etc. Better retention. Stressfull learning process will distance you away from what you are trying to learn.</p>
<p>I will continue with 7 actions in the next post.</p></div>

    <p><strong>1. Be proactive</strong> Focus your energy on what you can control &#8211; your circle of influence. Things that are out of your control (your circle of concerns) should be the least priority in your mind.</p>
<p><strong>2. Begin with the end in mind</strong> This is the big picture view of everything. You do something because it&#8217;s related to your end goal. Having end goal in mind lets you prioritize your task. The goal helps you to creatively develop and find the &#8220;required&#8221; tasks to achieve your goals.</p>
<p><strong>3. Put first things first</strong> All the tasks that you perform can be categorized into 4 quadrants. The priority of the tasks should be in the following order : Not urgent, but important &gt; Urgent, important &gt; Urgent, not important &gt; Not urgent, not important</p>
<p><strong>4. Think win/win</strong> This is the ultimate relationship goal. All involved parties benefit from the relationship. The relationship flourishes and all involved parties would do anything to keep the relationship going.</p>
<p><strong>5. Seek first to understand, then to be understood</strong> This is the key to the effective communication. You have to listen and understand your audience before you try to deliver your message. Once you understand their reasons from their perspective, then you can adapt your message to their situation so that you can be understood.</p>
<p><strong>6. Synergize</strong> This refers to putting together all the available resources and optimize their capabilities to achieve the best possible output. In simple words- work together, complement each other, strategize and optimize the capabilities .</p>
